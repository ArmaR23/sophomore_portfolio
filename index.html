  About me!
</h1>
  <p>Hi! My name is Arma Rahman. I am 16 years old and currently I am a Sophomore at Thomas A. Edison CTE Highschool. My shop class is Web App Development. My shop class is very interesting and fun as we get to decorate the web pages to what color we like and add images according to the information provided about the page.  </p>
