<h2>About me!</h2>
    <img src="blue_sky.jpeg" alt="pretty sky">
  
<p>Hi! My name is Arma Rahman. I am 16 years old and currently I am a Sophomore at Thomas A. Edison CTE Highschool. My shop class is Web App Development. </p>

<p>My shop class is very interesting and fun as we get to decorate the web pages to what color we like and add images according to the information provided about the page.</p>

<p>Along with my shop class I am also doing a cybersecurity program where so far I learnt the types of threat and who they usually can be from.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<p>Even though I am quite busy these days as obviously I have a lot of work that take time for me to finish and I also have to study but I try to also have free time for myself and enjoy things I like.</p>

<p><strong>Some of my hobbies are:</strong></p>
<ul>
  
  <li><strong>Playing games:</strong>I usually play games with my friends for example Genshin Impact and Roblox. I also play this game called "Block Blast", it requires a lot of thinking and can be a bit addicting.</li>
  <li><strong>Listening to music:</strong>I listen to music all the time even while I am working as I feel like it keeps me awake and it does not feel quiet.</li>
   
</ul>
<h2>Works I have done so far</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://armar23.github.io/lesson5_activity.html/" target="_blank">Kiri's kitchen üçú</a>: This was my first ever project I did for my client using CSS properties and decorating the website. <br>This is also probably my favorite project as I enjoyed using the CSS properties and decorating the page</li>
